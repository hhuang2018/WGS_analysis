# Whole genome sequence analysis for donor-recipient pairs
## Exploratory analysis pipeline


This is the first part script of the WGS for D-R pair project. This contains the whole genome sequence analysis pipeline, IBD test and other statistical tests.

This repository will be merged with ["gene-gene interaction" project](https://github.com/hhuang2018/WGS2017_R) which is still under development.

The final version of the scripts will be merged into one repository, and is set to release by the end of 2018.
